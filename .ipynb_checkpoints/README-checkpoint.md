### Environmental predictors of global food supply

## Introduction

Understanding worldwide crop yield is central to addressing food security challenges and reducing the impacts of climate change. Thus, the goals of this project are to (i) create a model of crop yield based on relevant predictor variables and (ii) determine which features are the most important in predicting crop yield.

## Data

* [Crop Yield Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset)
   
This dataset has over 28,000 records for the following variables: crop yield (hg/ha), country, year, rainfall (mm/year), average temperature, pesticide usage (tonnes). It includes the topmost consumed crops worldwide: cassava, maize, potatoes, rice (paddy), sorghum, soybeans, sweet potatoes, wheat, yams, and plantains and others. There are records for 101 different countries for years 1990 through 2013.

* [CO2 emmissions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yoannboyere/co2-ghg-emissionsdata)
    


## Scope

1. EDA: 

   * Align datasets by country and timeframe
   * Check for missing values
   * Check for highly correlated variables
   * Get basic stats

   
2. Model comparison:

   * Detemine the best machine learning algorithm for predicting crop yield
   
3. Random forest:

   * Rank the importance of variables to determine top predictors of crop yield

3. Visualization:

   * Correlation heatmap
   * Model performance
   * Rank of important variables

## Insights

This research project will provide insights on which environmental factors may be most important for crop production. Given pressures of future climate change, highlighting the importance of environemtal factors on global crop production could be useful in mitigating concerns over the future global food supply.
